## Description
When invoking the application, a social network API allows for creating, reading, updating, and deleting user's, user's thoughts, and thought's reactions. User's can be added to other user's friends list and removed. When a thought is created, a reaction can be added to it. If a thought is deleted, it's associated thoughts will also be deleted. If a user is deleted, their associated friends will also be deleted. This application mimics some basic functionality of a social network.
